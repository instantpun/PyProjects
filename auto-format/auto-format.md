This project was originally an experiment in automating security reports, but it could be tweaked for other purposes easily. 

The script accepts the contents of your clipboard as input, parses through it using a dictionary of pre-defined regex patterns, populates a template using the matches, and overwrites your clipboard contents with the finished product.

This eventually helped save a lot of time doing very repetitive taks that were primarly copy & paste.
